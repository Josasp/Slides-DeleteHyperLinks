# Slides-DeleteHyperLinks

This small Google Script is for removing any and all hyperlinks found in a Google Slides presentation.

### Installing

Open the Script Editor in your Google Slides presentation

```
```

Paste the script into the script editor

```
```

Then we need to enable Google Slides API

```
```

Replace the presentationId with the one from your presentation url and run!

```
```

Note, you may be asked for permissions by Google and warned against running this script, this is normal.
Just grant access, proceed at own risk but I promise there's no malicius intent in this simple script.
